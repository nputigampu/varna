Varna is a Fullstack E-commerce fashion store designed as a final project in Spiced academy.
Varna is developled by using Javascript, React.js, Redux as Frontend, backend Express.js and Node.js and postgres database.
This website servers mainly on Men's Fashion, Womens's Fashion and Accessories (Shoppers has wide range of collection to buy).
It has Login and Register features.
The main features for the wesbite are  filters by category, filter by price selector slider and filter by rating.
In addition to that user see the products by using search option.
Besides that shoppers has an option to sort the products by Newest, Price Highest, Price Lowest, Rating and so on
User can add/remove favourite products to wishlist.
Adding items/products to cart, update cart items(increase number of quantity, delete unwanted products).
At the moment Varna has a cardless(pay with card) checkout .
All the products I have listed in website are original data(price, rating, product, popularity) which I have manually extracted from rainforest API.
I wanted to give Varna a professional website look, so that I have added various categories under each section.
